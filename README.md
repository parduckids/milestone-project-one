## The idea: 

- Wavy Wake is a surf school from Australia, Marmite (fictional). They offer different surf courses from begginer to expert. The [website](https://parduckids.github.io/milestone-project-one) is created to help customers find essential info about Wavy Wake, to make it easier to book sessions.

## Technical information and Credits: 

- The Wavy Wake website's every page designed to be used on any screen sizes and is responsive. The [website](https://parduckids.github.io/milestone-project-one) has been created with [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and custom [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) with the help of [bootstrap framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)) by using bootstrap classes and without the use of bootstrap templates. The website responsiveness comes from a grid system that is implemented with [bootstrap classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/extend/approach/#classes). It has 4 pages and a 404 page.
- Images : The logo is created with [canva.com](https://canva.com) online graphic design tool. All the other images shown on the website are from [pexels.com](https://pexels.com). The image names haven't been change due to it's showing the original author of the image. The images are from various accounts from [pexels.com](https://pexels.com). Favicon created with [favicon.ico](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).
- Tools: The website is using [Bootstrap V.04](https://getbootstrap.com/) all around with added custom CSS3.
